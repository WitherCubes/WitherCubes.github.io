<p class=date> June 22, 2021 - By Sanjay Pavan</p>

<h2 id="Characters">Characters</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lencho&#8217;s family consists of his wife and his sons.</li>
<li>Postman and his employees helped and took part in the act of charity.</li>
<li>Postmaster is like head person in that post office. His friends and him helped Lencho by donating some money.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Before%20the%20Storm">Before the Storm</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lencho‚Äôs house was on a crest of a small hill. One from his height can see his whole corn farm.</li>
<li>Lencho expected for a little downpour of rain. Then he saw mountains of clouds at the north-east direction. Soon the rain came at his supper as he predicted.</li>
<li>The storm started with heavy wind and then continued with falling of large hailstones.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="After%20the%20Storm">After the Storm</h2>

<ul>
<li>Immediately after the hailstone storm Lencho was surprisingly shocked to see all of his corn plants have been destroyed more than the plague of locust. Lencho thought his family would go hungry that year.</li>
<li>After the hailstorm the cornfield looked as though it is covered with salt.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="The%20letter%20&amp;#38;%20the%20Postmaster">The letter &#38; the Postmaster</h2>

<ul>
<li>After the hailstorm Lencho was worried so much about the great destruction caused by the storm and wrote a letter to the God asking 100 pesos for his farming as he was his only hope.</li>
<li>Postmaster is the man who decided to help Lencho. Even he had put some money from his salary for helping Lencho. He also got some money from his friends for Lencho‚Äôs need.</li>
<li>The postman handed over the Lencho‚Äôs letter to the postmaster laughing heartily after seeing the address on the envelope. At first the postmaster also was laughing and then he firmly decided to help the poor Lencho by replying to the letter and giving his own money and getting help from other people.</li>
