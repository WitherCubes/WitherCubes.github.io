       -------- Before the Storm --------
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                ------- Lencho‚Äôs house was on a crest of a 
       |                                        small hill. One from his height can 
       |                                        see his whole corn farm.
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                ------- Lencho expected for a little downpour 
       |                                        of rain. Then he saw mountains of 
       |                                        clouds at the north-east direction.
       |                                        Soon the rain came at his supper 
       |                                        as he predicted.
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                ------- The storm started with heavy wind 
       |                                        and then continued with falling of
       |                                        large hailstones.
       |
       |

       |
       |
       -------- After the Storm ---------
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                ------- Immediately after the hailstone storm
       |                                        Lencho was surprisingly shocked to see
       |                                        all of his corn plants have been
       |                                        destroyed more than the plague 
       |                                        of locust. Lencho thought his family
       |                                        would go hungry that year.
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                |
       |                                ------- After the hailstorm the cornfield
       |                                        looked as though it is covered with 
       |                                        salt.
       |
       |
       |
       |
       |
       --- The letter &#38; the Postmaster --
                                        |
                                        |
                                        |
                                        ------- After the hailstorm Lencho was worried
                                                so much about the great destruction
                                                caused by the storm and wrote a letter
                                                to the God asking 100 pesos for his
                                                farming as he was his only hope.
                                        |
                                        |
                                        |
                                        ------- Postmaster is the man who decided to
                                                help Lencho. Even he had put some
                                                money from his salary for helping
                                                Lencho. He also got some money from
                                                his friends for Lencho‚Äôs need.
                                        |
                                        |
                                        |
                                        ------- The postman handed over the Lencho‚Äôs
                                                letter to the postmaster laughing
                                                heartily after seeing the address on
                                                the envelope. At first the postmaster
                                                also was laughing and then he firmly
                                                decided to help the poor Lencho by
                                                replying to the letter and giving his
                                                own money and getting help from
                                                other people.
