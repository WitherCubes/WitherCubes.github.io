                                        ------- The poet compares the same tiger when
                                                it is present in the zoo and present
                                                in the jungle.

                                                cage can walk only few quite steps
                                                with his vivid stripes.

                                        ------- He then says that the tiger actually
                                                should be crawling in the long grass
                                                and hunting the plump deer near the
                                                waterhole and adds that it supposed
                                                to be scaring the people in the
                                                village near the jungle with its&#39;s
                                                White Fsngs and claws.

                                        |
                                        ------- But instead the tiger was in the cage
                                                hearing the last voice of the
                                                patrolling cars and lying down and
                                                staring at the stars.
