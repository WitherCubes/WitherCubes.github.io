<ul>
<li><strong>1:</strong> Aid in camouflaging the presence of the predator before it rushes in.</li>
<li><strong>2:</strong> Prey that has quenched its thirst ensures consumption of hydrated meat for the tiger.</li>

<li><strong>4:</strong> Long grass</li>
<li><strong>5:</strong> Plump deer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Question%202:">Question 2:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>1:</strong> Tiger</li>
<li><strong>2:</strong> To catch the deer</li>
<li><strong>3:</strong> All of the above</li>
<li><strong>4:</strong> Locked in a concrete cell</li>
<li><strong>5:</strong> Baring his white fangs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Question%203:">Question 3:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>1:</strong> The tiger ignoring the visitors decipts that he does&#8217;t want to mkae eye contact with them with an upset that his powers and freedom to hunt were locked. These feelings were expressed in the ignoring eyes of the tiger.</li>
<li><strong>2:</strong> The poem points to the cruelty of animals in captivity by comparing the tiger in the zoo and in the wild. The tiger in the zoo was restricted to hunt it&#8217;s prey sliding through the grass. These animals also were brought to the zoo unwillingly from their natural habitat.</li>
<li><strong>3:</strong> The poet celebrates the strength of the tiger by mentioning its fierce power in the wild. He says that the tiger in the wild should be lurking in the shadows and crawling through long grasses to hunt a plump deer near the water hole. He also adds that the tiger should be growling at the houses at the jungle&#8217;s edge showing its white fangs and claws and freaking the people.</li>
