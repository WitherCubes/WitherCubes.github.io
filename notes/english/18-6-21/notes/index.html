<li>Lencho hoped for the rain or shower desperately as he is a farmer who is waiting for his ripe corns to grow and harvest. He compares the raindrops with 10 cents and 5 cents which helps in the growth of those corns.</li>
<li>Lencho says the raindrops were like new because he hoped for rain to come which in turn grows the corn and make it more edible for more money. The rain also makes buds, flowers to fruits from which he can get more products to sell to get more money.</li>
<li>During the pleasant rain suddenly strong wind began to blow. Along with the rain large hailstones began to fall. The hailstone&#8217;s colour truely resembled the new silver coins. Now he hoped that the hailstone rain passes quickly, but it lasted for an hour. The field was white, covered with hailstones as if covered with salt. It did leave a single corn. Even the flowers and all the plants were destroyed.</li>
<li>The hailstone rain lasted for an hour. It had destroyed everything. No corns were left, no leaves were left in the trees. Lencho&#8217;s farm was totally destroyed. Now his soul was fulfilled with sorrow and sadness. He lost all his hopes, but he had hope only in god.</li>
