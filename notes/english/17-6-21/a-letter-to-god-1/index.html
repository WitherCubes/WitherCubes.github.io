<p class=date> June 17, 2021 - By Sanjay Pavan</p>

<h2 id="Ans%201:">Ans 1:</h2>

<p>Lencho&#8217;s House was the only one in their valley. His house was located on the crest of a low hill. From this height one could see the river and the field of Ripe corn dotted with flowers.</p>

<h2 id="Ans%202:">Ans 2:</h2>

<p>Lencho was a farmer. In his field he had grown ripe corn. His first hope was to get same rain to his maize. Soon the rain came as he wished. But suddenly a strong wind blew with rain, very large hailstone began to fall. He secondly hoped that the hailstone fall would pass quickly, but that lasted for one to two hours.</p>

<h2 id="Ans%203:">Ans 3:</h2>

<p>Lencho had a couple of children. The elder boys were working in the field while the smaller ones were playing near the house.</p>

<h2 id="Ans%204:">Ans 4:</h2>

<p>It was during the meal, just as Lencho predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet.</p>

<h2 id="Ans%205:">Ans 5:</h2>

<p>When the rain began to fall Lencho went outside for no other reason than to have the pleasure to feeling the rain on his body, and when he returned he exclaimed &#8220;These aren&#8217;t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. The big drops are 10 cents and smaller drops are 5 cents.&#8221;</p>
