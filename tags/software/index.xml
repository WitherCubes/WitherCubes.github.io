      <description>Most Firefox users think that firefox has security and privacy features out of the box. The answer is that it&amp;rsquo;s certainly better compared to other mainstream alternatives (like Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome).
Why do people trust that Firefox more in terms of security and privacy than Google Chrome? The answer is simple because Firefox is a Free and Open Source Software. This means that anyone can audit the code of firefox and submit bug fixes, exploits to improve firefox and inspect the code if any malicious code is there in the browser.</description>

      <description>Operating System    I use Arch Linux as my operating system. I was once a Windows 10 user but then hated it after knowing how evil it is. I wish I could use Gentoo as my OS but I have a dumb laptop to compile and I love the AUR.
Programs    Web Browser    For my web browser I use Brave. It is better than any proprietary alternatives like Google Chrome, Vivaldi, and Microsoft Edge because Brave doesn&amp;rsquo;t collect user data and sell it.</description>
